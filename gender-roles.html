								<h2><a href="#">Gender Roles</a></h2>
							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								Historically, traditional gender roles in China were based off of yin and yang. Yin or "women" is described as soft, passive and weak. Yang or "man" is viewed as hard, dominating and assertive. Yin and Yang are opposites that complement each other but not necessarily equally. Traditionally it was very important to make sure that Yang was always dominate over Yin. This led to a separation of men and women with in the home, women were kept in the inner most part of the home while men were able to go freely. The thoughts that women should follow the lead of men led to the view that women should not have influence in public affairs. Women were obedient to men who were seen as the head of the family. At a young age women were taught to be obedient, to follow the lead of men. Women were first subservient to their father, then were married at a young age and in many cases moved in with her in-laws. Their main role was to produce a male in order to carry out the families blood line. If a women was able to give birth to a male she was more respected but still did not have a voice in the family. If her husband died the wife was only able to act as the head of the house until her eldest son was of age to take over. The views of Yin and Yang also account for the high rates of male births. After the law was passed that restricted the people of China to have only one child the rates of male births increased. People would have abortions if they found out they were expecting a girl, some would/will even pay to have a male embryo implanted to ensure a male baby. The strong traditional ties and views of Yin and Yang have had a strong impact on the current gender roles in China.

									<h3>Men In China</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Being a man in China comes with a lot of weight. Traditionally you are the head of the house, you would have controlled every aspect of your families life, in most cases you would be the sole provider and you were responsible for continuing your families blood line. Being the 'Yang' part of Yin and Yang means you are dominate, assertive and responsible for taking care of the 'Yin". With the one child policy many families did all they could to ensure that they would have a boy. Boys carried on the family name and were the more respected gender. This caused a gender imbalance. With all of the energy and time spent on helping females to have the same education and equal opportunities as men many people are now afraid that males are starting to be more submissive the females. Some schools and day cares now have playtime designed to increase the masculinity of the boys. This shows us that the views of Yin and Yang are still alive and well in China. Tradition has always been a crucial aspect of the Chinese culture. This is seen in their importance for passing on their families name, their rituals and tributes to their ancestors and their views on the traits of men and women. Men need to be more masculine, brave, and dominate females.

									<h3>Son vs Daughter</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									There are rational bases for this gender inequality. In this family system, sons are permanent members of their natal family and retain lifetime financial relationships with their parents. They are expected to contribute to their parents’ economic well-being even after they are married themselves. Thus, it is in their self-interest for parents to invest in sons because they may reap long-term returns from this investment. In contrast, daughters are only temporary members of their natal families before marriage, upon which a woman serves her husband’s extended family (Whyte and Xu 2003). Oftentimes, families will sacrifice the older daughter’s education for the younger son to have a better chance. Usually this is because the better education makes the so a better candidate for marriage and married sons provide more financial support.

								<p>
									Yu and Xie (2012) report large gender gaps in household work in contemporary China, with the lion’s share falling on the shoulders of the wife rather than the husband. It is quite possible that this traditional division of labor in the household, with women being mainly responsible for caring for children and the household, may impede realization of women’s full potential in the labor market.
